"""paper-agent CLI — academic paper fetch + lit review synthesis.

Latest stable: v3.9.9.9 (feature release; [P1-17] --source per-engine
filter shipped. See CHANGELOG [3.9.9.9]).
Implements paper-agent v4 design principle: after 5 minutes of Cloudflare
challenge failure, stop iterating and surface a "your turn" handoff to
user. Real human browser sessions remain the only reliable Cloudflare
bypass for academic PDF recovery.
