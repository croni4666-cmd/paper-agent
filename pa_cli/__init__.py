"""paper-agent CLI — academic paper fetch + lit review synthesis.

Latest stable: v3.9.9.6 (audit-only release; no new features, see
CHANGELOG for the 14 audit rounds that produced this version).
Implements paper-agent v4 design principle: after 5 minutes of Cloudflare
challenge failure, stop iterating and surface a "your turn" handoff to
user. Real human browser sessions remain the only reliable Cloudflare
bypass for academic PDF recovery.
